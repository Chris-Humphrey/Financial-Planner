# Finance Tracker

## Application to help with your personal finances

Some things to implement:

*   Categories(line-items) for each line item that you can programatically add to the form. Budget for each line-item:
    -   Required: Rent, Utility's, Grocery's
    -   Optional: Restaurants, Bars, Movies, clothes shopping, other shopping, gas, 
*   Add your categories, input your personal information the form, adding fields or removing fields
    -   create section for adding your own with a section for recommendations that they can instantly add
*   A route for investments
    -   shows up-to-date api information for investments and savings accounts
*   APIs
    - geographic data based on industry for items such as cost of living
    - api for current offerings of investment and savings options


## Post-MVP

*   A route for tax information
*   Add Update functionality to reducer/ Dashboard Results to edit in real time
*   Add local storage
*   User authentication to save your personal data
*   Prior salaries month over month or year over year
*   Suggestions based on spending habits. Ex: Someone spends 10% of each months paycheck on eating out for lunch. Instead you save it or invest it.
    Now you have 120% extra money in savings every year. Or allocate it to a vacation trip. Or just save it for a shopping spree at the end of the month/year.
